    Hi Daniel, how are you doing? I know we didn't meet each other for a long time, I'm not feeling okay lately. The good news I'm keeping myself on the surface, thanks to my dear friend, you! I was reading your letters every day, one story settled in my heart for a long time, so I decided to write my own, don't be a critic please, it's my first one. Once upon a time...
    There lived a boy, in the center of the city. His pink house was one of the oldest in the town. The cars were buzzing and bustling, impatiently skipping each other, crossing the green, yellow and red lines. People were walking, talking, singing and yelling. Between the houses were ropes, with colorful cloths on them. The life was so burning, sadly for our little hero, living in the first floor of the low building.
    He didn't like being at home, the school wasn't sweet too. Boys were fighting, girls were laughing and teachers were yelling. At least it was a bit far from the city, having the prettiest garden around. He was walking by foot, it's better than waiting in the red lights, right?
    The school-day has finished, the sun was settling down, the azure closed the entire sky, only the small feathers of clouds were flying in the flowing wind. The long, thin grass was slowly dancing, like the daily routine, before going to sleep. The boy was walking, stepping on the dark green grass, despite he didn't want to. The wind blew to his face, for a second he closed his eyes, looked away, and when opened, saw him. A tall man, in a black, shining suit. On his head - a nice cylinder, on his hands - short white gloves. His cheeks were red, his eyes frown and closed, he was swinging, dancing like the only flower of the field. He was playing, holding a violin, like his only beloved lover, a shine of his life. The thin sound of strings was cutting the boy's heart, leaving him to stare endlessly on the stranger, forgetting about home and school. With the final high notes, he ends the show, bowing to the field. Putting back his violin, slowly, he goes back, into the corner of the city. The boy was asking all the questions inside his mind, unable to give the answer. The sun has long been gone...
    It was the day of his final math exam. He woke up tired, with a bit blue under his eyes. Yawning, his face got frozen in the halfway, when he looked at the clock, realizing he is getting late. The blood slammed to his head, as an iron hammer. He jumped of out of bed, took his yellow shirt, black jeans and the blue pen, running out of door. While rushing on the crowded streets, he tries to arrange some coins in his hand. Finally finding the free taxi, he kindly yells, to drive him to school. Sweating at the back seat, he blankly gazes into the window.
    Eventually the driver finds the school, boy runs to the closed doors, knocks it, until the old doorkeeper slowly opens it, telling him to rush a bit. Arriving at the school's gym, where the final test is arranged, he sits to his place and starts to write. Eating his nails, he hears, how the teachers ask to give the papers after five minutes. Angry, nervous, scared, he looks up and sees the old woman, coming for his paper. She throws her hand, grabs the the test out of his hands, and goes. The poor boy, stares on the gray walls. The other teachers ask him to go...
    He leaves the school, moves forward, trying to stop the tears with his small, red fingers. He can't see, within the blurred field, he sees a black dot, coming to him. He makes a few more steps and holds his breath. He hears the violin, then the piano, and then the deep, calming voice. The violin, thin like an ice, the piano, hitting like the thunder, the voice, sad, like the never-seen ocean, the alone bird flying to his new, far home. The boy bursts to tears and falls into the wave of grass, while the musicians, play the strings on the heart of the old lost fields...
