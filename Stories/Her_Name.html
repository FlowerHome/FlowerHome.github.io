The black soft clouds hugged the dark sky, nearly closing the shiny moon that lights up our streets along with the beautiful stars. Glowing tears dropped from the roof of our balcony. It was May, the crying girl in the sky, waiting for April to come. I remember a story that my brother told me when we would go to our playground during the rains. I was little, too little.
In the endless sky full of white big islands, a girl was living. She liked the sun, green grass, flowers, and the wind. Unfortunately for her, she was living in the coldest part of the sky, her home was next to the forceful blizzards and white shroud. The sun was white from her side, it was so pale, so even the bluebells were seeming gray. Every day, she would leave her house and go where the sun was. Arriving, there was a garden full of flowers and trees. They all were closed, she would sit and wait until they open, but that never happened.
One day, she saw a girl, barefoot, blue dress, yellow hair... She was sitting there, opening the flowers, daffodils, tulips, magnolias, peonies, azaleas... Her hands were gentle, slowly pulling the leaves. May couldn't take away her eyes, it was the first time she saw an open flower. She was scared to come closer, she was looking from afar until the girl walked away.
May came home, seeing that the blizzard subsided, the sun got brighter, as was her life. May's skin got a bit brighter from pale, her hair became a bit ruddy, and her tired eyes became happier.
The next day she got up early and ran to the garden, it seemed much nearer than the previous time. The anticipation was long and painful, but it was worthy. The girl came back, slowly walking across the bridge, smelling the flowers and opening the ones she didn't have time to open last time. May came near and asked, "What's your name?" The girl replied, "I'm April, I live on the other side of the garden." April could feel the cold breathing of May, even if her ears were all red. They were silent, May sat near on the grass, April continued to open the flowers and give them to May. The sun got tired, the flowers wanted to sleep, May didn't want to leave, but April waving the hand walked away into the fog of clouds. She stayed there, lying in the green, counting the stars, until her eyes closed by themselves, and she fell into the world of dreams.
The sun pierced May's eyes, waking her up. It was April, sitting next to her, making a crown from yellow lilies. They were running, laughing, looking into each other's eyes, without words. When the sun was getting away again, April asked, "Go home this time, please."
The next day, as usual, May was waiting, but nobody came. It was already sunset, she got up and started walking all across the garden, looking for her girl. It was silent, not as always, too silent. She didn't go home, trying to find the nearest house. When she came too far, the fragile ground below started to fall. May was too scared to continue, dropping on her knees, she cried. The clouds colored into dark blue, tears were falling down from the cracks...
The next day she got up in her bed, pale. She left and walked. Standing there, emotionless, staring into the void of the garden, every flower was open, she saw her dream, that became her new nightmare. She sat, and started counting the flowers, then the leaves and then the blades of grass...
