        <h1>On motivation and time managment</h1>

    Since the ancient philosophers people were emphasizing a great attention on productivity and time managment, writing ideas about the right life style, distributing tasks and spending time on work. The ideas didn't change much, as didn't change the human brain and the basic principles. The problems with procrastination were always in the society, the more people make ways to achieve cheap pleasure, it's much easier to spend entire lives on a couch. My principles are:

    1. Satisfaction gives pleasure.

    2. Work makes tired.

    3. The process is individual.

    Satisfaction can be in many things. It can be a satisfaction from the process of learning and working itself, or big numbers like read pages, burned calories, days fasting etc. But despite how much can the process be interesting, varying for every person, it will always become boring if done too much. We need a lot of work to accomplish great things, which can become a problem for people trying to not get bored of spending many hours a day on the same activity.

    Being tired from work is entirly another story and should not be confused with getting bored from it. Sometimes there are situations when we like what we are doing, but the physical capabilites don't allow us to continue it. That occurs when our motivation kicks in, but our health comes in between.

    Everything again is individual for everyone in anything, there are people that don't enjoy working at all, or that don't get tired for months of intensive study. People also change and that always motivated, energized machine can one day become tired, lazy consumer.

    Reosoning about this everything, can give different answers. To keep going when motivation goes away, people make lists and practice self discipline. To not getting tired they wake up early, or drink too much coffee. These solutions are not great and don't work for everyone.

    The idea is to try to find or build an activity, that's so easy, that can be practiced in tired or unmotivated state, also being usefull and informative. Of course the best always will be based on the individual's preferences, but let's assume we want to hit as much area as we can.

    First of all taking care of yourself, not too much (so it doesn't take the big part of the free time). It's both rewarding and satisfying, easy and fast to do.

    Listening, watching and reading. It's important to choose the most interesting and lightweight material, so it doesn't become a second work, which will make us more tired and frustrated. The length, genre, source are fully individual, it's a good idea to keep a list of interesting topics, websites you didn't try yet and so on. Consuming information gives the satisfaction, a good written book or a nice made video can give also the pleasure from process. Changing the topics and creators frequently can give a diversity in it. If you forget about it try to place a reminders, so when you get up from your work, remember about them.

    Walking, meditating and socializing. It's not always possible to walk or engage in a physical activity when you're already tired, but it can clear the mind, give a place for thoughts or become a chance to do many other things that we procrastinate to do, like going to the store. These three activites are very similar, yet can be used in different situations. It's important to take a time to think and analyze our thoughts and ideas.

    Easy said than done, there are already a lot of good books about keeping journals, making lists, arranging days by activities. But at least the ones that I've read, they don't emphasize the idea, that doing all that isn't easy, nearly impossible for a busy or mentally unstable person. Procrastination is essential in our daily lives, but we can use that time doing something easy, and rewarding, so we don't get tired of it. Try to make the procedure of creating lists interesting, gameify it, use your notebook for everything, writing every appearing though in it. We are not machines, anything interesting can become stressful, learning new skills are frustrating. Discipline is important, but much more important is to take breaks, and use them effectively.
