        I'm fucked up, like, completely, every time I lose to my desires or in contrary don't do what I think I should do, hurts so much like I've crashed all my bones.  The hardest thing to do is to think, while your mind is full of chaos. I'm not in a state to write today, but I will probably never write again if not today.

        Days go buy, world around you is constantly moving, it doesn't matter what's going around, it will never stop. You have to eat, sleep, talk and work, imagine how frightening is it, to stop the life, even for a short duration. There are people who used their gold valued time to help us, try to listen to them, at least for their sake.

        Eat normally, not a junk food, even if it's a small portions, the things you like, apples, toasts, tea, cheeze... People underestimate the importance of food's effect on our body, it can heal in many ways.
        Keep yourself warm and hidrated, if you forget to wear your favorite sweater, put it in front of your working place, the same method for your cup of water.

        Loneliness is not the lack of communication, actually it's the lack of similarity between people. You can feel lonely even in the biggest community, because they don't share the same opinions and interests that you do. Watching people having my same struggles, or trying to achieve the same goals, make me connected to them even if they will never know about me, probably...
