        Today I was late for private class, but my teacher said it's okay, gave me some candies, said I'm very clever and should try to pay more attention. I said I though it was Saturday, when it was Friday, she sincerely laughed, without replying. I love my teacher, I think I will miss her after a year.
        In this two years I saw a lot of good people, and I understood how many good people I lost. Sometimes change comes very late, the time you though was the best is actually the worst, and vise versa. 
        You can find courage even in a very small things. I talk and understand people that are not real, I look at bugs and want to help them climb the tree. My flowers are still alive, even if they do not bloom, they're going on.
        Life never was 'enjoyable' for me, I live in a good family, with good friends, but I think I can leave it in every second, it's just people need me more than I them. The only thing that keeps me alive is the desire to see people happy, and to see myself happy, I'm a human being too after all. My flowers could die months ago, but they are keeping a company to my coffee trees.
        There was a time I though I can be happy only in a certain way, yes being what you want to be is very important, but you probably will never achieve happiness without small things around us, many people lost the sight and they don't even know that. What's the meaning in being angry, anxious, jealous?

        Don't overthink, please, do everything in the best and <i>simplest</i> way possible, trying to achieve the ideal or fast results will be a losing option. 

        Sometimes you get, sometimes you don't...
        These are words from a small movie, which name I forgot. You can't always be a winner, otherwise winning would not have a meaning. Trying patiently was the best way for me.

        Never understimate yourself. It's harder to do than remember, especially for me. Do you think all these people knew that they will be remembered through history? Most of them were just doing what did they like. Many were not successful at any kind, read the story of Tesla, the device with which you read this, was made because of him, still he was out of money and hated by everyone.

        It was a long rent, I wish you a good day and strength to continue the journey, I need to go do my homework.
