Hi friend, how are you doing?
Today was a boring day, but strangely overwhelming and passive. I woke up soo tired, I think I've messed up with my sleeping schedule. I should wake up early tomorrow at any cost, so I will sleep earlier next time, now I barely sleep at 0:30. Before breakfast, my mom asked me to go to the store and buy some things. She forgot to mention one thing so I went back again, I was angry at first, but in the store, the cashier gave me a free candy, saying "take this my child"...
IT'S SUCH A SMALL THING, BUT YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH DOES IT MEAN. Today you barely see it, I haven't get a kindness from a stranger for a year maybe, if not more, I can't even remember any. Damn, I can't even remember any kindness from my family, only some things with my friends. It's a rare thing for me to hear "let me do this for you" or "how are you doing?". The last time I hugged someone was my friend at school, he just came, hugged me and didn't let for a minute. I dunno what he wanted but it was warm...
Btw my grandpa today didn't feel nice too, so I gave that candy to him. He's not doing fine lately, I hope he will find the peace someday.

I made a plan for learning today, did some stuff, I don't really remember. I'm still figuring some things out, it's a tough process, but it's important, the good plan is 80% of the work. I went out to walk in a park with my friends, it was fine, I like walking and seeing the last bits of nature in this city.

I still think a lot about the future, and I don't like it, I'm scared of loosing the time, or opportunities. Sometimes I can just stare to the point and not realize how I lost 10 minutes inside my mind, my brain is constantly working, I can't have a proper rest.

I hope you're doing better than me. If you struggle on anything, don't be like me, work on it.

The second question: What you wish you were doing?
I wish I was an artist, but of course not the ordinary one. I'm still a programmer, or even a mathematician, and I want to compose my art trough those areas. I hate the resemblance that 99% of people make everyday. Most of the art we see today is the work of hand, and the small grain is the work of mind. The reality is boring. I want to tell the stories that are not possible, paint that things that aren't imaginable, write the music, that's unimaginable. Unfortunately, as always the dreams I have aren't easy, I could just wish I was an ordinary digital artist, but it's not mine.

Maybe this all is very toxic, but you can't always be positive, it will just blow up one day.
