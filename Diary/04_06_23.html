Hello, I was missing you a lot. How are you doing?
I finally found the courage to write, it makes me feel warmer. Also I'm now alone at home, and it's so calm, I like being alone here. Lately I watched a movie, "At Eternity's Gate". To be honest I was crying during it, especially in the end. It had a big impact on me, how I see the world, how I feel about my future. More and more I understand that I'm very pessimistic, sadly I can't do anything about it.
Lately I got myself a new friend, and we got pretty close with each other. I've told him many things, I hope I'll not beat myself afterwards because of it, he seems really nice. He's a good friend of my good friend, so I trust him. I found out he has ADHD too, it's the first time I see someone with it near me. He didn't know about that, but he doesn't seem to want to work on it either, after all we are very different people.
I've started to stay more alone, especially in the gardens and nature, I find it the only thing that makes me forget about this world for a moment. I started to appreciate art like never before, I want to become a great artist.
Remember when I was answering a question "what you want to do?", now I understand what I want to do, to do what makes me happy. I don't want to be someone popular, or enter the history, I just want to be at peace, nobody understands that. Nobody even wants that, people throw themselves into the fire, living life in a rush, chasing, fighting for unimportant things, for what?
I don't like people, I feel safe only around my friends.

I want to start to publish my works somewhere, I just need to find a nice place for it. I also want to start drawing and playing music, I have to schedule my days again, and stop worrying or beating myself. Please, try to do the same.
And don't forget to ask yourself a question, why you do what you do, and are you happy with it?

Take care.
