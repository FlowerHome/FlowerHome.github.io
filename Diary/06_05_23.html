Skipping is okay
Hi, a new day. I again skipped the previous day, maybe I just didn't have enough time for writing. I went to school to help my friend to write the exam, then a hour later went back home. I don't remember what I did after that, but that day I went to the gym, then I saw my friend and came home pretty late. I woke up really tired today, took a little bit care of myself. The grayness of the world seems more overwhelming today, despite the weather is great. I finished my programming language today, I was working on it for a month or too, there's left only some small optimizations, I'm happy for my accomplishment, sadly nobody can understand it, at least the people I know.

I want to answer to the first question I asked in the previous letter: What are you good at?
I would like to hear your answer too.

I really don't know, it's so hard to define the "good". The moment I think I'm good at math I look at Feynman, who knew the integral calculus, when he was 15. But let's get out of this box and come to use some delusions, which I so much liked when I was a kid.
I'm good at programming, I was doing it for many years. I'm good at math and logic, I can see what others can't see, I find the invisible magic in it.
I'm good at creative artwork, they're full of abstraction, hidden messages, personal ideas.

I'm the creative logician, I find meaning in everything, and I like giving a meaning to my work too. I wish I knew so much many other things, the list can be so big, starting from history and music theory, finishing with quantum physics and complex calculus. I've tried many things, and I wasn't good at them, for example in music, but maybe after some time I will try again and be better. For now I will focus on the things I'm already good at, then try some new things in the process. It's a long journey, but I hope I'll succeed.
