It could be better, if I've worked on it.

Today is the day when my lazy self finally decided to make this website alive! Sorry for making you wait for so long. Here I will share my passing days, thoughts, and other things.
Today I deconstructed my computer, I got tired from wasting my time on unimportant things. I also downloaded a blocker for my phone. Now I'm using my laptop, which is not suited for games. I like games, but it's really easy to get lost in them. I have so many things to do, heck, even just going to a park and sitting there is much better than this everything. Today people lost the touch with nature, it's sad. I understand them, it's hard for me to just be alone, when everyone is so near, and it's too important in today's society.
