Ars longa, vita brevis

Hey dear friend, how are you doing?
I'm happy you remember about me. Still you don't write very often. I see you have some problems, maybe some little sleep and time for yourself will help.
Reading is a good thing, try to read more. I found it always helps me, not only the books of course, but art is an important place in our lives. Philosophy became kind of a pill for me, because all my problems seem philosophical. I don't get anxious when I don't have enough money, or someone says something to me. I get sad only when see my and others' life is pale...
I'm not scared from the fact, that maybe I'll never even answer to my own questions. Why we are doing all these things everyday, for what, what's the meaning in beginning and end of the life?
(SPOILER A LONG PHILOSOPHICAL TEXT DON'T READ BOOMER MATERIAL)
I don't remember what I was doing these days, but I remember what I was reading most of the time. I've discovered Arthur Schopenhauer's works, they're kinda similar to the thoughts I have. I'm just like a little dot in the universe, still I can't say my life doesn't have any impact on the world, if I can make even a single creature feel better, now or in the future. It's a paradox, in the macro plane we are worthless, the ration between the whole humanity and the universe is so big it's not possible to express or imagine; Still, putting only a single seed into ground will create a forest, making new lives of the most different forms.
Considering that our life is not meaningless, because we impact the world, then what is the meaning of the world itself? The answer is either "there is none" or "there is no answer". Let's look at both answers.
There is no meaning in the universe. It's straightforward, there are just infinite laws of physics (of course abstract, the physics and maths people made are not objective), our mind is a bunch of neurons, believing in an idea that we have consciousness (or soul). The moment we die, we feel nothing, not numbness, but imagine a literal nothing.
The second answer is recursive, i.e. it happens every time we go further in much deeper sense. Looking at the less intelligent creatures, for example worms, they don't even know about our existence, but we can significantly impact on them. They can't sense us in any way. Now let's change the places and now we are in the place of worms, and assume there is a more supreme being, that we don't feel any way. So we can understand, our life has the meaning that supreme being gives us (the "God"). But in that logic there may be a more supreme being, that will decide the fate of others. And so until the end.
In history people were praising the nature and it's forces, because the huge hurricane could destroy your thousands years old village in a second, that forces were supreme. Now we are not feared of much natural disasters, so they seem normal to us. The same way we understand more about our universe, stars that would define someone's future, now are just a huge spheres of different gases.
The third answer, that I mostly think of, is that there is no meaning in finding the meaning in life itself. It's like when kids during lessons ask "why fire is red" or "why numbers work the way they are". Everything we see, even this text, it's made straight from our brain, it is like this because we see it like this, while some other creature would sense it different way, and thus have different values and meaning of life. 
Living life as it is, striving to do what we want is my understanding of right path. I even understand the cruel people, if they want to be a bad, it's their way of living. I want to live simple, art fulfilled, altruistic life, with few people that understand me.
I've started to read some Marcus Aurelius, I didn't go too far, I will give a feedback in the future :P

Ahh I dunno. I just feel sorry for myself. The hardest thing is to forgive yourself, isn't it? Everything would be much easier if I wasn't complicating my and other people's lives. Maybe one day I will find the answers to my questions, but not today.

I made my first watercolor painting today! It's veryyy bad and messy, but I like it :>
I got very motivated from one amazing movie, I totally recommend, if you're a artistic person: "At Eternity's Gate". I feel like I share a lot of similarities with Vincent, I sympathize him so much, like looking into the mirror. Sometimes I feel that I'm mad too, maybe it's right, and even better...
