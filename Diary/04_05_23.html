You're beautiful.
Hi, it's me, again, talking to myself ^_^
Today I got sick for the first time this year, it feels so good, because I finally can concentrate on my health, I wish I could do that everyday. Many people can't see all the damage they do with self-hate and self-harm, I have that problem too :)
I was drinking tea, eating properly, keeping myself warm and I'm already feel much better. I was doing nothing for the first half of the day, I felt much better after going to the park. I watched some anime series for the first time in many years, I picked Jujutsu Kaisen. I'm not the biggest fan of fighting, I like more calm, everyday life things, but lately life is boring, so why not dream a little?
I skipped yesterday's journaling, I don't remember why, maybe it's not important. Also I only now noticed that May is the fifth month, I'm bad at using calendar :D

Every time I try writing, I can't keep myself consistent, it's so hard to do, like trying not to sleep when you're in a bad and really tired. That's ADHD, I try to do something with it, but it's like an endless curse, maybe I should live like this for all my life, like Da Vinci did. I've not read about his life much, but I know he would just sleep in the middle of a day, or change his focus on different things many times, leaving most of his works unfinished. I love Da Vinci :>
I hope this time this will be better, but I can't give promises.

For many times, I was writing my dreams, ideas, fears on a piece of paper, but they're all gone, so let's try again, while I have a free time. I don't know if I should do it all at once, I'll let myself to think about them all, maybe I'll change it in the future.

THE SUPER GUIDE TO UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ACTUALLY ARE AND DESTROY THE ILLUSIONS OF SELF:
    * What are you good at?
    * What you wish you were doing?
    * What are you doing?
    * What are you bad at?
    * What are your fears?
    * What are your problems?
    * What are the mistakes you made?
    * What are the mistakes you continue to make?
    * What's important for you?
    * Why are you the person you are now?
    * When you're sad?
    * When you're happy?
    * What you want to become?
    * What are you now?
    * What's your life goal?
    * When will you die happy?

Totally it's 16 questions, but while answering, try to think what you can do to use it in your life, and how to do it. In the question "What are you bad at?", understand what can you do to improve the skills you lack of.

By the way I've tried to keep my work scheduled and time managed, if you don't have any problems following plans, do it, it's super helpful, but not for me ;)

That's it, I would write more and more, but let's not make my small brain tired <3
