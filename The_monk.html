Oh, let's go to the hill
See, there, far from afar
One day it will go away
But my dream will live
Here in the grass fields

Oh, let's go look at
The crowd of the dancing flowers
Wouldn't they be shy?
How beautiful their lives are
I wish it were we

Through the grey sky
Over an endless sea of clouds
Lives an unforgiving dream
Makes us try again
To climb the hill
Over and over again

But as time goes, runs away
Mind can't wait forever
Let's do it together this time
You're not alone
I will make the path easier
Let's go climb the hill
To our endless dream
