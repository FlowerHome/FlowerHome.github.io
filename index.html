Hi, didn't see each other for a long time, how are you doing?
I got lost lately in my own thoughts, it's a chaos that I don't know how to express, writing this is pretty hard. I'm scared, for my future, for my life. In the same time I'm fully careless, I want to live the way I want without looking into bullshit that society tries to feed me about life. 
If you want to be creative, but nobody sees you, do it, do it silently and invisible, like a ghost, who finds it's purpose in fulfilling it's high desires of art and beauty. Having many friends, lots of money, social status, it will never give a pleasure of happiness, but only the illusion of it.
We live in the illusion of one's pleasures, thinking that after we grow up we will be happy, after we grow up we think we'll be happy when we die, we die and nothing changes in this world.
The genius, the only moving cog in this world of stupidity and degeneration, is the minds of the history, philosophers, artists, musicians, who saw their enormous success after their soul has runned from this hell.
I'm tired of the cage of my body, this prison of flesh will not keep me forever. I came out from the cave many years ago, but I haven't realised that, the prisoners of the cave told me I'm crazy, blind, only to continue to look on the shadows of the wall. It's better for me to be alone, blind in the darkness, but be able to see the sun.
